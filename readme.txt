== Description ==

Wordpress Strong Authentication lets you authenticate users with a second
factor of possession. Only if the user is able to provide this second factor,
he is allowed to login.

Such a second factor can be an OTP display card, an OTP hardware token, a Yubikey,
a smartphone App like the Google Authenticator or access to an mobile phone
to receive an SMS or access to an email account.

The use then needs to authenticate with his wordpress password and in addition with
a code, generated by his device or sent via email or SMS.

All the devices are managed in the backend (privacyIDEA)[http://privacyidea.org], the Strong Authentication
plugin forwards authentication requests to this backend, which you can easily run
on the same machine or anywhere in your network.

== Installation ==

For installing the wordpress plugin simplay copy the file 
wp-strong-authentication.php to the wordpress directory

  ./wp-content/plugins

== Configuration ==

Please add at least a hostname or IP address of your backend server privacyIDEA.
If you do not want to verify the SSL certificate in this connection, enter "0" at the verification configuration.

Please note: You need to have the same users in the LinOTP server. 
You can achieve this by configuring an SQL Resolver and presetting this to
Wordpress.

== Troubleshooting ==

If you misconfigured the plugin, you might not be able to authenticate anymore!

So it is always a good idea to add some users to the "excluded users" list.
These users will be able to authenticate without a second factor and
even if the authentication server should be down.

Another possibility is to disable the plugin by removing or renaming the 
plugin directory.
In this case is will fall back to the old wordpress passwords.
